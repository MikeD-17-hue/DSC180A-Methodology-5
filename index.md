Weakly Supervised NLP, Section B15

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 
\The most interesting topic in my domain this quarter has been the exploration of weakly supervised learning. Especially using large language models as a guide for text clustering, with the existing llm's, there are more potential possibilities to solve some complicated classification tasks.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** 
\For my Quarter 2 Project, I would try to implement some more advanced models and techniques instead of replicating the current implementation. And also use the classification method to solve some real world problems. I would like to know what are some areas that weakly supervised classification can do well on.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** 
\In my current Quarter 1 Project, a potential change I would consider is incorporating a more diverse range of data sources. Initially, the project heavily relied on some simple datasets with coarse-grinded label, which may have limited the model's comprehensiveness and accuracy. By integrating varied data sources and more labels, the project could achieve a more holistic and robust analysis, leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** 
\In addition to the current techniques, I would be interested in exploring the use of reinforcement learning and transfer learning in my project. Reinforcement learning would enable the models to learn optimal actions through trial and error, which is particularly useful in dynamic environments. Transfer learning, on the other hand, could allow the leveraging of pre-trained models on large datasets to improve performance and efficiency, especially when dealing with limited data in specific project areas.
